I'm also a rock climber and an amateur DJ (vinyl, baby!) and an avid reader (aspiring to be a writer, somewhere along the line). I currently live in Porto, Portugal.</p> <p>So I finally decided to go forward with this long standing idea that sparkled awhile back. First, the envisioning inside my mind, itemizing all the topics, parsing them, categorising them and finally building a virtual mindmap. Next step (and it took a step further in becoming a serious affair once I bought a dedicated paper notebook), I started to jot down these ideas, and a form emerged. Finally, after stumbling randomly on some other blogs, the final touch for the backbone of this initiative to fly came through.</p> <p>So, what is this about, you ask. First things first. I started to work in the technology world, and quickly got pretty sure that Project Management was the thing and became a goal to pursue it professionally. Soon enough, I got from end user product training, to help with requirements gathering and definition (a bit of business analysis started to pick up) and to help configure some parts of the products that were going live into production. And then, naturally came the ask to start managing all these tasks and go into serious project management since I was seconded in the UK, which definitely helped. I was hooked! Luckily, I was allocated to projects that used frameworks and methodologies (we\u2019ll get into more details on what these are and their differences in the following posts) and I was exposed to project management full mode.</p> <p>My career has then spanned from doing projects in Healthcare, Retail, Logistics &amp; Transportation, E-commerce, Geographic Information Systems, Oil &amp; Gas, Industrial Processes, Public Administration, Financial Services and Food industry among others while going through intense experiences and multiple contexts, cultures and settings that made me evolve in a relatively short period. Since I\u2019m (quite) obsessive with learning, stacking information and transforming it into knowledge (theory into practice) while using the only learning mechanism known to man: trial and error. With all these powerful tools coupled with another powerful idea mentioned by Steve Jobs in his Commencement Speech at Stanford University - \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d, I\u2019ve set myself to do something about it.</p> <p>More info on my LinkedIn Profile</p> <p>And then\u2026 with all of this going on, another idea started to form - take this knowledge and accumulated experience and give it a structure to increase effectiveness and efficacy as a continuous improvement for myself while also sharing this out there.</p> <p>This will serve two goals:  </p> <ol> <li>It's a way to structure all the knowledge I have so far and see if I really understood the concepts (following the Faynman's technique to lear anything - \"explain it until you know it\" - this is my own quote to sum up the teachings)  </li> <li>Share my experience in a way that can be utilised by anyone that has an interest in it or trying to get practical knowledge on specific topics</li> </ol> <p>That leads to the vision of continuous learning and improving of oneself to be the best person one can be.</p> <p>I also publish a newsletter format that can be subscribed at: Substack</p>"},{"location":"PM-domains/","title":"Glossary of Terms","text":"<p>This living repo intends to provide and quick and clear definition for all the concepts that are used, generally, in Project Management and used throughout this Playbook.</p>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#a","title":"A","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#b","title":"B","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#c","title":"C","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#d","title":"D","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#e","title":"E","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#f","title":"F","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#g","title":"G","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#g_1","title":"G","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#h","title":"H","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#i","title":"I","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#j","title":"J","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#k","title":"K","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#l","title":"L","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#m","title":"M","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#n","title":"N","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#o","title":"O","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#p","title":"P","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#q","title":"Q","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#r","title":"R","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#s","title":"S","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#t","title":"T","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#u","title":"U","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#v","title":"V","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#w","title":"W","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#x","title":"X","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#y","title":"Y","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"PM-domains/#z","title":"Z","text":"<ul> <li>under construction.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"change-management/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"communication-info-flow/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"development-approach-lifecycle/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"performance-measurement-review/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"planning/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>\u201cPlans are nothing. Planning is everything.\u201d</p> <p>Dwight Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States</p> <p>According to the PMBoK, every project is a:</p> <p>\u201ctemporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service or result\u201d.</p> <p>PMBOK\u00ae Guide \u2013 Sixth Edition (2017)</p> <p>Bearing this in mind, in order to create or deliver the output, there is a need to structure the way (the \u2018how\u2019) to do it, that is, given the inputs (resources, either physical or informational - such as requirements, or manpower or specific tools, etc.) that need to be transformed into the desired outputs through transformation.</p> <p>All this needs to be carefully identified, defined and controlled to ensure not only that it delivers the actual output as intended (\u2018efficacy\u2019 or \u2018doing the right thing\u2019) but also with the right amount of resources to achieve it (\u2018efficiency\u2019 or \u2018doing things right\u2019) - ideally, no more, no less.</p> <p>And that is where planning comes in.</p> <p>Planning is something that requires thoughtful, critical and dedicated thinking while keeping an open mind regarding uncertainty and all the dynamics from the context that it\u2019s inserted in. Naturally, the keyword is its dynamic nature (verb intended) as opposed to static - once a plan is captured and documented (several artifacts can be used to make it up, such as WBS, activity list and gantt chart, among others), we need to frame it as a baseline for once things get moving.</p> <p>We cannot mistake the essence and the actual value of planning with the tool that we use to achieve it, since it should be assumed and accepted that planning (or plans as a result of the effort of planning) will change and evolve once we start executing it - not to be feared.</p> <p>Also to bear in mind is that, not only will planning evolve and change over time, but also that it needs to constantly do so as its own process. This means that planning must occur continuously through a constant effort.</p> <p>And why?</p> <p>Because planning is focused on preparing for the execution of something that occurs in reality, and reality is governed by multiple and interrelated variables, themselves evolving and changing, and so, in this context, we need to adapt to these changing circumstances as we go along. Reality is a moving target and so we cannot stand still while navigating through it.</p> <p>And here lies the complexity. Think of it as \u201ctrying to build a plane in mid-air\u201d.</p> <p>Recap:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It\u2019s a verb (planning), not a noun (plan);</p> </li> <li> <p>The nature of planning is dynamic - environment and their variables are changing;</p> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s a constant effort throughout the project;</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not mistake the medium for the message - it\u2019s not the plan in itself that matters but the layout to the direction towards the outcomes, hence the need to have a baseline to compare to once things get moving;</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"planning/#what-are-the-key-elements-in-planning","title":"What are the key elements in planning","text":"<p>Let\u2019s first go over the dimensions and elements of planning while also detailing its own process where it unfolds.</p> <p>Planning is one of the phases or process groups (as depicted in the PMBoK), that is it has sufficient importance, is critical to quality and has complexity to have a dedicated set of processes within every project, since it gives an answer to the \u2018how to do it\u2019 question.</p> <p>Although the process itself, the artifacts that are generated and the level of effort spent by human and financial resources differ according to the project type, budget and risk profile, it must be present in order to properly manage the project - the key issue here is to tailor the process according to these project characteristics.</p> <p>So, in essence, planning is the art of drawing a roadmap towards the objective(s) set out for the project.</p> <p>This roadmap is an exercise that starts with idea storming, in a collective manner bringing multi-perspective and angles that will allow for a more creative and enriched exercise. It will then be captured into a document (text, visual or some other form). Hard and critical thinking goes into it, bringing along:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the experience from similar undertakings - the lessons learned;</p> </li> <li> <p>the embedded culture from the specific settings where the project will develop - the shared attitudes and values of the organisation,</p> </li> <li> <p>the way of working translated into methods and practices that the undertaking can benefit from, such as processes, policies, guidelines that can help tailoring our roadmap.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The common thread of all this 3 items are patterns - information transformed into captured knowledge that allows us to understand the organisational capabilities.</p> <p></p> <p>The roadmap is made up of:</p> <ul> <li> <p>the objectives must be clear and explicit from the start (where we are running towards or, more technically, the strategic domain) and what the expected outcomes will be. These become the targets to achieve and where all the energy must be directed to;</p> </li> <li> <p>the scope of the undertaking (the limits of our terrain) where we identify all the needed skills and expertise to carry out the initiative that is translated then into resources and effort that will be put into it to obtain the outcomes - that is, we need to know, and constantly refine, the boundaries of what falls under the work to be done and what does not;</p> </li> <li> <p>the course of action that we need to take in order to keep focus on what we need to obtain - since we\u2019re refining the objectives that ultimately lead to the outcomes and keeping score of what is in our scope, we also need to keep adjusting the path along the way in terms of both strategic and tactical decisions.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The roadmap is a tool that enables us to have a bird\u2019s eye view of what, how and where we are going, which is the start for us to really begin to detail and move into the tactical domain.</p> <p>The tactical approach, spearheaded by program/project management as a method to handle initiatives or needed changes, is to tackle the complexity and breadth of the objective(s) and scope. This means that one needs to decide if there is a need to breakdown the scope into several projects that are interrelated and dependent (program approach) or if a large major project will be the best option to obtain synergies.</p> <p></p> <p>The complexity, level of risk, effort and skills needed might justify breaking down the initial path into smaller ones (into 4 as our example above) and chart a project for each one.</p> <p>However, if we decide to do it, the program view becomes essential in order to coordinate and ensure that all that we can take advantage from each project is shared along with the other: such as decisions that proved to increase risk or turn out to be wrong, or a specific method or approach that one of the projects followed and proved to be more efficient.</p> <p>Apart from this, we need to ensure that the goal is still the objective for all these smaller projects to obtain, not losing focus or sight.</p> <p>Recap:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Planning is process that fits into the overall process groups that make up a project;</p> </li> <li> <p>Being a process, it can be performed/executed at every time it needs to (not just at the beginning of the project);</p> </li> <li> <p>The purpose of planning is to design a roadmap that leads to the project\u2019s goal and objectives;</p> </li> <li> <p>It benefits from 3 key items: lessons learned, the culture in which the project will be performed and the way of working of the organisation performing it;</p> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s the moment where we move from strategic to tactical perspective, detailing how we are going to achieve our goal and objectives.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"stakeholders/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"team/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"uncertainty-complexity/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"},{"location":"value/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The delivery of value is the focus for any mandated project that is intended to implement a change and, ultimately, impact all the stakeholders and its environment through the planned benefits. </p> <p>There is an important discintion to be made between value and benefits.

This could be reducing costs, speeding up delivery times, or improving customer satisfaction. Keep these definitions as guiding principles throughout the project.</p> <p>During execution, continually refer to these value definitions. When decisions arise, consider how they align with the intended value.</p> <p>Engage Stakeholders Early and Often Regular stakeholder engagement ensures that the project stays aligned with expectations and allows for adjustments as needed. Periodic feedback sessions can help verify that the project continues to deliver the intended value.</p> <p>Quick, focused check-ins or surveys can be effective in maintaining alignment and addressing shifts in stakeholder needs.</p> <p>Prioritize Value in Your Backlog In an Agile or similar framework, prioritize tasks based on the value they deliver. Tackling high-value tasks first ensures that the project begins delivering value early on.</p> <p>Regular backlog reviews with the team and stakeholders help maintain focus on maximizing value and keeping everyone aligned with the project\u2019s goals.</p> <p>Make Cost-Benefit Decisions on the Fly Quick, informed decision-making is often required to balance costs and benefits. Develop a simple framework to guide these decisions, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently to deliver maximum value.</p> <p>Empower the team to use this framework, facilitating faster decision-making and maintaining a focus on value.</p> <p>Adapt and Improve Continuously Regular retrospectives or reviews focused on value delivery are key to continuous improvement. These sessions should identify actionable adjustments to enhance the project\u2019s value.</p> <p>Small, targeted improvements can have a significant impact on overall project success.</p> <p>Use Metrics that Matter Select a few key metrics that directly relate to the project\u2019s value objectives, such as customer satisfaction, cost savings, or time-to-market. Consistently track and review these metrics to ensure the project remains on course.</p> <p>Visibility of these metrics across the team helps maintain focus and allows for timely course corrections.</p> <p>Keep the Team Aligned on Value Consistent communication of value objectives keeps the team aligned with the project\u2019s goals. Ensure everyone understands how their contributions support the delivery of value.</p> <p>Starting each cycle or phase with a brief reminder of value goals reinforces their importance and keeps the team\u2019s efforts focused.</p> <p>Conclusion: Bringing It All Together Focusing on value in project management enhances the likelihood of achieving meaningful outcomes. Through consistent stakeholder engagement, informed decision-making, and continuous adaptation, projects can deliver value that aligns with both stakeholder expectations and organizational goals.</p>"},{"location":"work-delivery/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Under construction.</p>"}]}
