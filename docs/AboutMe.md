# About Me and this Project

My name is Bernardo Marques, I'm a father of a baby girl and in love with my sweetheart and mother of my beautiful child. I'm also a rock climber and an amateur DJ (vinyl, baby!) and an avid reader (aspiring to be a writer, somewhere along the line). I currently live in Porto, Portugal.

So I finally decided to go forward with this long standing idea that sparkled awhile back. First, the envisioning inside my mind, itemizing all the topics, parsing them, categorising them and finally building a virtual mindmap. Next step (and it took a step further in becoming a serious affair once I bought a dedicated paper notebook), I started to jot down these ideas, and a form emerged. Finally, after stumbling randomly on some other blogs, the final touch for the backbone of this initiative to fly came through.

So, what is this about, you ask. First things first. I started to work in the technology world, and quickly got pretty sure that Project Management was the thing and became a goal to pursue it professionally. Soon enough, I got from end user product training, to help with requirements gathering and definition (a bit of business analysis started to pick up) and to help configure some parts of the products that were going live into production. And then, naturally came the ask to start managing all these tasks and go into serious project management since I was seconded in the UK, which definitely helped. I was hooked! Luckily, I was allocated to projects that used frameworks and methodologies (we’ll get into more details on what these are and their differences in the following posts) and I was exposed to project management full mode.

My career has then spanned from doing projects in Healthcare, Retail, Logistics & Transportation, E-commerce, Geographic Information Systems, Oil & Gas, Industrial Processes, Public Administration, Financial Services and Food industry among others while going through intense experiences and multiple contexts, cultures and settings that made me evolve in a relatively short period. Since I’m (quite) obsessive with learning, stacking information and transforming it into knowledge (theory into practice) while using the only learning mechanism known to man: trial and error. With all these powerful tools coupled with another powerful idea mentioned by Steve Jobs in his Commencement Speech at Stanford University - “connecting the dots”, I’ve set myself to do something about it.

And then… with all of this going on, another idea started to form - take this knowledge and accumulated experience and give it a structure to increase effectiveness and efficacy as a continuous improvement for myself while also sharing this out there.

This will serve **twoo goals**:  

1. It's a way to structure all the knowledge I have so far and see if I really understood the concepts (following the Faynman's technique to lear anything - "explain it until you know it" - this is my own quote to sum up the teachings)  
2. Share my experience in a way that can be utilised by anyone that has an interest in it or trying to get practical knowledge on specific topics

That leads to the vision of continuous learning and improving of oneself to be the best person one can be.
