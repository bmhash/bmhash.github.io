# The Management from the Trenches
*A Field Guide for troubling and anxious times*


A Project Manager is a role that has a different meaning, in terms of reponsibilities, skill set, authority and range of action when working on any initiative.

A few characteristics that can be found on a Project Manager are:

* Has responsibilities to their team and taking on different roles depending on the context and situation at the time - mentor, coach, (servant) lead.
* Knows their **playbook** or if one does not exist, it creates a structure of sorts to allow for a more focused approach to their work, in terms of processes, tools and frameworks.
* Rely on continuous improvement through constant learning and introspection to have enough data to obtain insights into what needs to be sustained, what needs to be improved and what needs to be abandoned.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically with a servant leadership as a mindset.
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome by assisting the team in delivering value to the Customer.


## The Vision

The idea behind this playbook on aspects of management around projects is focused on self and collective improvment and the impact on the outcomes.


## The Goals

Following the vision for the playbook, there is a need to set goals and objetives that allow to continuously sustain and thrive to implement it a little further. Thus, the main goals for the playbook are:

* To help set the tone for the team dynamics and the way of working for a common understanding on the values, principles and general and specific concepts around them.
* To improve overall efficiency and effectiveness for team members and the whole team as a cohesive ensemble.
* To reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls through a quality first mindset.
* To improve both hard and soft skills while contributing and sharing knowledge.
