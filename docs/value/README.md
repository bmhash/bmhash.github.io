# Overview

The delivery of value is the focus for any mandated project that is intended to implement a change and, ultimately, impact all the stakeholders and its environment through the planned benefits. 

There is an important discintion to be made between value and benefits. As it can be hinted from the previous statement:

1) **benefits** are gains realized through the impact that the project has on its stakeholders, while;
2) **value** is related to the net result between those benefits and the cost needed to achieve them.

While benefits, in the context of projects, programs and portfolios, have a discipline of its own - *benefits realisation management* - with a life cycle and framework to ensure its delivery, our focus within the project management discipline is around value:

- First, as a measure to indicate if we're having a positive impact on the management of all the resources committed to transform into the desired outputs and;
- Secondly, as a driver (our north star) whenever we need to tackle uncertainty, ambiguity and/or complexity.

The benefits are estimated and defined in the business case, while the goals and objetives are established in the project mandate, where value is fleshed out in the form of requirements that form the scope and guide the delivery.

That is why is key to understand **how to focus on value during project execution** can lead to more successful outcomes.

1. Start with the End in Mind
Before initiating a project, define what value looks like to stakeholders. This could be reducing costs, speeding up delivery times, or improving customer satisfaction. Keep these definitions as guiding principles throughout the project.

During execution, continually refer to these value definitions. When decisions arise, consider how they align with the intended value.

2. Engage Stakeholders Early and Often
Regular stakeholder engagement ensures that the project stays aligned with expectations and allows for adjustments as needed. Periodic feedback sessions can help verify that the project continues to deliver the intended value.

Quick, focused check-ins or surveys can be effective in maintaining alignment and addressing shifts in stakeholder needs.

3. Prioritize Value in Your Backlog
In an Agile or similar framework, prioritize tasks based on the value they deliver. Tackling high-value tasks first ensures that the project begins delivering value early on.

Regular backlog reviews with the team and stakeholders help maintain focus on maximizing value and keeping everyone aligned with the project’s goals.

4. Make Cost-Benefit Decisions on the Fly
Quick, informed decision-making is often required to balance costs and benefits. Develop a simple framework to guide these decisions, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently to deliver maximum value.

Empower the team to use this framework, facilitating faster decision-making and maintaining a focus on value.

5. Adapt and Improve Continuously
Regular retrospectives or reviews focused on value delivery are key to continuous improvement. These sessions should identify actionable adjustments to enhance the project’s value.

Small, targeted improvements can have a significant impact on overall project success.

6. Use Metrics that Matter
Select a few key metrics that directly relate to the project’s value objectives, such as customer satisfaction, cost savings, or time-to-market. Consistently track and review these metrics to ensure the project remains on course.

Visibility of these metrics across the team helps maintain focus and allows for timely course corrections.

7. Keep the Team Aligned on Value
Consistent communication of value objectives keeps the team aligned with the project’s goals. Ensure everyone understands how their contributions support the delivery of value.

Starting each sprint or phase with a brief reminder of value goals reinforces their importance and keeps the team’s efforts focused.

**Conclusion: *Bringing It All Together***
Focusing on value in project management enhances the likelihood of achieving meaningful outcomes. Through consistent stakeholder engagement, informed decision-making, and continuous adaptation, projects can deliver value that aligns with both stakeholder expectations and organizational goals.
