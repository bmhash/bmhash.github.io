# About Me

I am Bernardo Marques, father of a baby girl and currently living in Porto, Portugal with my sweetheart. I'm also a rock climber and an amateur DJ (vinyl, baby!) and an avid reader (aspiring to be a writer, somewhere along the line).

Professionally, I'm a Project Manager with 11 years of experience, always within the IT world, and started as a trainer, tester, business analyst and, fianlly moved to the Project/Program Management world throughout this period and within a few industries, such as Healthcare, Retail and Ecommerce, Geographic Information Systems, Oil & Gas, Financial Services and Food.

From all the accumulated work experience and several training/certifications and related study and reading, I feel like I'm on the perfect timing to start structuring and publishing all this knowledge and share it with the world.

This will serve two goals:
1. It's a way to systematise all the knowledge I have so far and see if I really understood the concepts (following the Faynman's technique to lear anything - "explain it until you know it" - this is my own quote to sum up the teachings)
2. Share my experience in a way that can be utilised by anyone that has an interest in it or trying to get practical knowledge on specific topics

That leads to the vision of continuous learning and improving of oneself to be the best person one can be.
