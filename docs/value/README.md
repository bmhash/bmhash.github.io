# Overview

The delivery of value is the focus for any mandated project that is intended to implement a change and, ultimately, impact all the stakeholders and its environment through the planned benefits. 

There is an important discintion to be made between value and benefits. As it can be hinted from the previous statement, the benefits are gains realized through the impact that the project has on its stakeholders, while the value is related to the net result between those benefits and the cost needed to achieve them.
