# Overview

The delivery of value is the focus for any mandated project that is intended to implement a change and, ultimately, impact all the stakeholders and its environment through the planned benefits. 

There is an important discintion to be made between value and benefits. As it can be hinted from the previous statement:
1) **benefits** are gains realized through the impact that the project has on its stakeholders, while;
2) **value** is related to the net result between those benefits and the cost needed to achieve them.

While benefits in the context of projects, programs and portfolios have a discipline of its own - *benefits realisation management* - with a life cycle and framework to ensure its delivery, our focus within the project management discipline is around value.
Firstly, as a measure to indicate if we're having a positive impact on the management of all the resources committed to transform into the desired outputs and, secondly, also as a driver (our north star) whenever we need to tackle uncertainty, ambiguity and/or complexity.
